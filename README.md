# Security Learning Roadmap (for Go Engineers)

This roadmap is for backend engineers who currently "just use" security libraries (JWT, bcrypt, AES, RSA) as boilerplate, but want to **understand the concepts** and **choose the right tools confidently**.  

It‚Äôs structured as a **6-month plan** with resources, weekly goals, and expected outcomes.

---

## üìÜ 6-Month Study Plan

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Foundations (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Understand core cryptography terms and categories.

  - Watch: Computerphile videos (hashing, encryption, RSA, signatures)
  - Task: Write a personal glossary of security terms

- **Week 2: Hashing**
  - Read: *Crypto 101* (Ch. 1‚Äì2)
  - Practice: `crypto/sha256` and `bcrypt` in Go
  - Compare: SHA256 vs bcrypt for passwords

- **Week 3: Symmetric Encryption**
  - Read: *Crypto 101* (Ch. 3)
  - Practice: Encrypt/decrypt with AES-GCM in Go
  - Explore: AES-GCM vs AES-CBC

- **Week 4: Asymmetric Encryption & Signing**
  - Read: *Crypto 101* (Ch. 4‚Äì5)
  - Practice: RSA sign/verify in Go
  - Try: ECDSA in Go and compare

---

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Applying to Web Systems (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Learn how primitives are applied in real systems.

- **Week 5: Password Storage**
  - Read: OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet
  - Practice: bcrypt vs argon2id in Go
  - Project: CLI to hash & verify passwords

- **Week 6: JWT and Session Security**
  - Read: Auth0 JWT Best Practices
  - Practice: Implement JWT with HS256 and RS256
  - Compare: HMAC vs RSA signing

- **Week 7: TLS and HTTPS**
  - Read: Cloudflare blog ‚ÄúHow HTTPS Works‚Äù
  - Practice: HTTPS server in Go with self-signed cert
  - Learn: certificate chains and trust

- **Week 8: OAuth2 & OpenID**
  - Read: *OAuth 2.0 Simplified* (Aaron Parecki)
  - Watch: Okta Dev YouTube tutorials
  - Project: Small OAuth2 client (GitHub login)

---

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Secure Design Thinking (Weeks 9-12)

**Goal:** Move from "I know tools" to "I can design securely."

- **Week 9: Threat Modeling**
  - Read: OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet
  - Task: Threat model a sample API (e.g., banking app)

- **Week 10: Vulnerabilities**
  - Read: OWASP cheat sheets (SQL Injection, CSRF, XSS)
  - Project: Build a vulnerable Go API, then fix it

- **Week 11: Secure Coding in Go**
  - Read: Go Security Best Practices ‚Üí <https://golang.org/doc/security>
  - Practice: `math/rand` vs `crypto/rand`
  - Learn: timing attacks and `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`

- **Week 12: Defensive Strategies**
  - Study: least privilege, defense in depth, fail secure
  - Add: rate limiting, CSRF protection, secure headers to an API

---

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Advanced & Practice (Weeks 13-20)

**Goal:** Build & break real cryptosystems.

- **Weeks 13-14: File & Data Encryption**
  - Project: CLI to encrypt/decrypt files with AES-GCM
  - Add: password-based key derivation (PBKDF2/argon2id)

- **Weeks 15-16: Digital Signatures**
  - Project: ‚Äúsecure updater‚Äù ‚Üí sign a file with RSA/ECDSA, verify before run
  - Compare: RSA vs ECDSA performance

- **Weeks 17-18: Attack & Defense**
  - Tool: hashcat (crack MD5/SHA1 passwords)
  - Lesson: why bcrypt/argon2id resist brute force

- **Weeks 19-20: CTF Challenges**
  - Site: <https://cryptopals.com/>
  - Goal: Solve at least first 2‚Äì3 sets of challenges

---

### Phase 5 ‚Äî System-Level Knowledge (Weeks 21-24)

**Goal:** Think like a security engineer.

- **Week 21: Case Studies**
  - Read: postmortems (JWT ‚Äúalg:none‚Äù, Heartbleed, Equifax)
  - Lesson: how crypto misuse leads to real breaches

- **Week 22: System Security Principles**
  - Read: *Security Engineering* (Ross Anderson), focus on protocols & identity

- **Week 23: Full-System Hardening**
  - Project: Harden an old Go API:
    - TLS
    - secure headers
    - JWT
    - password hashing
    - rate limiting

- **Week 24: Review & Summarize**
  - Task: Write a personal security cheat sheet
  - Include: glossary, safe defaults, library choices
