# Zero Trust Architecture

## üîë Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify Explicitly**  
        Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points: identity, device health, location, service, workload, etc.

2. **Least Privilege Access**  
        Grant users, devices, and applications only the minimum access they need. Enforce just-in-time and just-enough-access.

3. **Assume Breach**  
        Design security controls as if an attacker is already inside your network:
        - Segment networks and services.
        - Monitor continuously.
        - Contain threats by limiting lateral movement.

## üîê mTLS vs TLS Decision Matrix

| Communication Pair            | Use Case                                    | Recommended Security Setup                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service ‚Üî Service**         | Microservices / API calls inside your infra | ‚úÖ **mTLS** (short-lived certs via cert-manager, Vault, or SPIRE).<br>Strong service identity, encrypted traffic.                 |
| **Frontend ‚Üî Backend**        | Browser / Mobile App ‚Üí API                  | ‚ùå No mTLS.<br>‚úÖ Use **TLS (server cert only)** + **JWT/OAuth2/API keys** for client auth.                                        |
| **Service ‚Üî Database**        | App ‚Üí DB (Postgres, MySQL, etc.)            | ‚öñÔ∏è Either:<br> - ‚úÖ **TLS + password/role** (simpler, common).<br> - ‚úÖ **mTLS** if you have PKI automation (Vault, cert-manager). |
| **Service ‚Üî Message Broker**  | Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, etc.                 | ‚öñÔ∏è Often support mTLS.<br>‚úÖ Use mTLS if your PKI is automated (e.g., Kafka + Vault).<br>Otherwise TLS + SASL/username.           |
| **Service ‚Üî Third-party API** | Stripe, AWS, Google, etc.                   | ‚ùå Almost never mTLS (providers don‚Äôt support it).<br>‚úÖ TLS (server cert only) + **API key / OAuth token**.                       |
| **Service ‚Üî B2B Partner API** | Bank, legacy enterprise API                 | ‚úÖ Sometimes **mTLS required** (they issue you a client cert).<br>Usually static certs + manual renewal.                          |


### ‚úÖ Rules of Thumb

* **mTLS is best for internal service-to-service auth** where you control both sides.
* **Frontend clients (users) should never manage certs** ‚Üí use tokens instead.
* **Databases/message brokers** ‚Üí mTLS is ‚Äúdefense in depth‚Äù, but not strictly required unless compliance needs it.
* **3rd-party APIs** ‚Üí mTLS only if explicitly required. Otherwise, tokens/keys.


‚ö° Shortcut:

* **Inside cluster (trust boundary):** mTLS.
* **Outside cluster (users, SaaS APIs):** TLS + tokens.
* **Infra (DB/broker):** TLS + password/role is enough unless you‚Äôre in high-security or regulated environments ‚Üí then mTLS.

---

## üîê mTLS Approaches: Istio vs. SPIFFE/SPIRE vs. Vault PKI

Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures **both client and server authenticate each other** using certificates. The challenge is:

* How to **issue certificates**?
* How to **renew them automatically**?
* How to make services use them **without changing app code**?

These three approaches solve the problem differently.

---

### 1. **Istio (Service Mesh)**

#### Concept

* Istio is a **service mesh**. It injects a **sidecar proxy (Envoy)** next to every service.
* Envoy handles **mTLS**, routing, retries, metrics, logging, etc.
* Istio has its own CA (`istiod`) to issue and rotate certs automatically.
* Applications **do not need to change** ‚Äî they just talk over plain HTTP/TCP, Envoy upgrades it to mTLS.

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ServiceA
    participant EnvoyA as Envoy (Sidecar A)
    participant Istiod as Istiod CA
    participant EnvoyB as Envoy (Sidecar B)
    participant ServiceB

    Note over EnvoyA,EnvoyB: Startup Phase
    EnvoyA->>Istiod: Request cert (CSR)
    Istiod-->>EnvoyA: Signed cert + key
    EnvoyB->>Istiod: Request cert (CSR)
    Istiod-->>EnvoyB: Signed cert + key

    Note over ServiceA,ServiceB: Communication Phase
    ServiceA->>EnvoyA: HTTP request
    EnvoyA->>EnvoyB: mTLS (X.509 certs validated)
    EnvoyB->>ServiceB: Forward plain HTTP request
    ServiceB-->>EnvoyB: Response
    EnvoyB-->>EnvoyA: mTLS response
    EnvoyA-->>ServiceA: HTTP response
```

#### Pros

* ‚úÖ **Zero app code change** (sidecar does TLS).
* ‚úÖ Full service mesh features (traffic control, observability, retries).
* ‚úÖ Automatic cert issuance & rotation.

#### Cons

* ‚ùå Heavyweight (adds complexity, CPU/memory overhead).
* ‚ùå More components to operate (control plane, sidecars).
* ‚ùå Overkill if you only need mTLS without mesh features.

---

### 2. **SPIFFE / SPIRE**

#### Concept

* **SPIFFE (Spec)** defines a standard identity format: `spiffe://<trust-domain>/<path>`.
* **SPIRE (Runtime)** issues **X.509 SVIDs** (certificates) or JWTs that encode these SPIFFE IDs.
* Applications or sidecars can use these SVIDs for mTLS authentication.
* SPIRE runs agents on each node to automatically fetch and rotate certs.

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ServiceA
    participant SpireAgentA as SPIRE Agent (Node A)
    participant SpireServer as SPIRE Server (CA)
    participant SpireAgentB as SPIRE Agent (Node B)
    participant ServiceB

    Note over SpireAgentA,SpireAgentB: Startup Phase
    SpireAgentA->>SpireServer: CSR for ServiceA
    SpireServer-->>SpireAgentA: SVID (cert + SPIFFE ID)
    SpireAgentB->>SpireServer: CSR for ServiceB
    SpireServer-->>SpireAgentB: SVID (cert + SPIFFE ID)

    Note over ServiceA,ServiceB: Communication Phase
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: mTLS handshake
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: Presents SVID with SPIFFE ID
    ServiceB->>ServiceA: Presents SVID with SPIFFE ID
    ServiceA-->>ServiceB: Validates SPIFFE ID
    ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Validates SPIFFE ID
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: Application request
    ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Response
```

#### Pros

* ‚úÖ Standardized identity (SPIFFE IDs portable across systems).
* ‚úÖ Automatic cert issuance & rotation.
* ‚úÖ Flexible: can be integrated with Istio, Envoy, or custom apps.
* ‚úÖ Lighter than full Istio if you only want identity + mTLS.

#### Cons

* ‚ùå Apps (or sidecars) may need some integration with SPIRE Agent.
* ‚ùå Less feature-rich than Istio (no traffic routing, observability).
* ‚ùå Learning curve around SPIFFE/SVID concepts.

---

### 3. **Vault PKI**

#### Concept

* HashiCorp Vault has a **PKI secrets engine** that acts as a Certificate Authority.
* Services (or agents) request short-lived certificates.
* Vault issues certs, and services store them locally (e.g., in a file).
* Services must load and use these certs in their TLS config for mTLS.

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ServiceA
    participant VaultAgentA as Vault Agent (Sidecar A)
    participant Vault as Vault PKI
    participant VaultAgentB as Vault Agent (Sidecar B)
    participant ServiceB

    Note over VaultAgentA,VaultAgentB: Startup Phase
    VaultAgentA->>Vault: Request cert for ServiceA
    Vault-->>VaultAgentA: Signed cert + key
    VaultAgentB->>Vault: Request cert for ServiceB
    Vault-->>VaultAgentB: Signed cert + key

    Note over ServiceA,ServiceB: Communication Phase
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: mTLS handshake
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: Presents Vault-issued cert
    ServiceB->>ServiceA: Presents Vault-issued cert
    ServiceA-->>ServiceB: Validate cert (trusted CA)
    ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Validate cert (trusted CA)
    ServiceA->>ServiceB: Application request
    ServiceB-->>ServiceA: Response
```

#### Pros

* ‚úÖ Very flexible PKI system.
* ‚úÖ Good for both humans (devs) and machines (services).
* ‚úÖ Powerful policies and secrets management.

#### Cons

* ‚ùå App code must use the certs (unless wrapped by Vault Agent + proxy).
* ‚ùå More manual integration than Istio or SPIRE.
* ‚ùå If certs expire and service doesn‚Äôt reload them ‚Üí outages.

| Best Use Case         | Full service mesh with policies      | Standardized workload identity across clusters | Flexible PKI + mTLS without mesh  |



### üìù Final Take

* **Use Istio** if you want **mTLS + service mesh features** and don‚Äôt want to touch app code.
* **Use SPIFFE/SPIRE** if you want **portable, standard identity (SPIFFE IDs)** with automatic cert rotation but not a full mesh.
* **Use Vault PKI** if you already use Vault for secrets and want a **flexible PKI authority**, but you‚Äôll need to handle certificate reloads in apps.

You can see the simple demo for mTLs [here](https://github.com/ysmnababan/learn_cryptography/tree/master/notes/zero_trust_policy/manual-mTLS).
The implementation only cover manual mTLS. 
For the `Vault PKI` or the `Istio` implementation is not needed for now because this mTLS approach
is only helpful for more complex and distributed service. The demo will be updated whenever the system is changing toward distributed approach.
